WANem is a Wide Area Network Emulator, meant to provide a real experience of a Wide Area Network/Internet, during application development / testing over a LAN environment. Typically application developers develop applications on a LAN while the intended purpose for the same could be, clients accessing the same over the WAN or even the Internet. WANem thus allows the application development team to setup a transparent application gateway which can be used to simulate WAN characteristics like Network delay, Packet loss, Packet corruption, Disconnections, Packet re-ordering, Jitter, etc. WANem can be used to simulate Wide Area Network conditions for Data/Voice traffic and is released under the widely acceptable GPL v2 license. WANem thus provides emulation of Wide Area Network characteristics and thus allows data/voice applications to be tested in a realistic WAN environment before they are moved into production at an affordable cost. WANem is built on top of other FLOSS [Free Libre and OpenSource] components and like other intelligent FLOSS projects has chosen not to re-invent the wheel as much as possible.

From a functionality perspective WANem hooks into the Linux kernel towards provisioning the network emulation characteristics and extends the functionality with additional modules. Based on a re-mastered Knoppix cd WANem allows quick and easy setup in any development environment with an intuitive web interface for purposes of configuration.
